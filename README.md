## Project Overview
This project analyzes the White Wine Quality dataset to understand the factors affecting wine quality. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, visualization, and optional machine learning steps to predict wine quality.

**Tools Used:**
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (optional for ML)
- Power BI (for interactive visualization)

  
 **Insights from Analysis**

- Wines with higher alcohol content generally have better quality.

- Volatile acidity negatively impacts wine quality.

- Residual sugar shows little correlation with quality.

- Positive correlations observed among density, fixed acidity, and citric acid.

- Outliers exist in some features (like alcohol and sulphates), but most data is consistent.

- There are no missing values in the dataset, making it clean for modeling.
